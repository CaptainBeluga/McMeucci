# Project Status
The application was completed in less than a week (**October 3rd 2024** -> **October 10th 2024**) and deployed online about a week later due to bureaucratic and security tasks.

Unfortunately, it **couldn't** be used at our school because the school currently has an **existing agreement** with a company that provides vending machines for snacks and drinks, which makes our initiative **impossible**, as selling products outside the contracted company is **completely illegal**.

The current domain is **[mcmeucci.shop](https://mcmeucci.shop)**, and it will remain accessible until **October 10th 2025**, at **11:59 P.M.** After this date, the website will be **sunset** ðŸŒ‡. Enjoy it until you can ðŸ˜­.
